                Barkhas is a Freshmen student at NUM - University of Applied Science. At the end of his high school, he has found his passion towards photography and started to take photos with his phone.

            <p class="text-2">
                As his skill grew, he knew that he would take amazing photos with a proper camera. He lended cameras from people and learned to hand a camera. The fun he was having with the camera and the control was awesome. Soon, he got his own one and began his journey.
